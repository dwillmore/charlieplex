# Charlieplex
This repository is a collection of code to manage charlieplexing.  It was initially developed for the
CH32V003 by way of the ch32v003fun repo, but can readily be adapted to run on many common microcontrollers
which allow the configuration of GPIO pins to be individually set to input or output.
